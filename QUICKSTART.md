## Tips for Using the App

1. **Check Multiple Timeframes**: The default analysis uses 1-hour data. For longer-term investments, you may want to modify the timeframe in the code.

2. **Don't Rely on Single Indicators**: The app combines multiple indicators to give you a holistic view. Pay attention to the "Analysis Factors" section.

3. **Consider the Strength Score**: Higher strength scores (70+) indicate stronger conviction in the signal.

4. **Risk Management**: Always use stop-losses and take-profits. The app provides suggestions in the recommendations.

5. **Market Conditions**: Technical analysis works best in trending markets. In highly volatile or news-driven conditions, use additional caution.

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors
Make sure you've installed all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### API Rate Limits
If you're getting rate limit errors, add delays between requests or use API keys in the `.env` file.

### No data returned
Check your internet connection. The app requires connectivity to fetch market data from Binance and Yahoo Finance.
