### Interpreting Candlestick Patterns

#### Reversal Patterns

   - Previous candle: Red (down)
   - Current candle: Large green (up)
   - Current engulfs previous completely
   - **Signal:** Strong reversal to upside

2. **Hammer**
   - Small body at top
   - Long lower shadow (2x body)
   - Short or no upper shadow
   - **Signal:** Rejection of lower prices

3. **Morning Star**
   - First: Large red candle
   - Second: Small body (star)
   - Third: Large green candle
   - **Signal:** Very strong reversal to upside

### Understanding Entry/Exit Points

#### Stop Loss Levels

**Example:**
```
Entry: $45,000
Stop Loss: $43,200 (4% risk)
Reasoning: Based on 2x ATR ($900) | Below support at $43,500
```

**What this means:**
- If price drops to $43,200, exit the trade
- You'll lose 4% of your position
- Stop placed below key support level
- Stop accounts for market volatility (ATR)

**Types of Stop Loss:**
1. **ATR-Based:** Adapts to volatility
2. **Support-Based:** At key structural level
3. **Swing Low-Based:** Below recent low
4. **Volatility-Based:** Percentage-based adaptive

#### Take Profit Levels

**Example:**
```
Entry: $45,000
Take Profit: $49,400 (9.78% profit)
Risk/Reward: 1:2.44
Reasoning: 1:2.4 R/R ratio | 9.8% target | Balanced setup
```

**What this means:**
- If price rises to $49,400, take profits
- You'll gain 9.78% on your position
- You're risking $1 to make $2.44 (good ratio)
- Target based on dynamic calculation

**Risk/Reward Explained:**
- **1:2** means risk $1 to make $2 (minimum acceptable)
- **1:2.5** means risk $1 to make $2.50 (good)
- **1:3** means risk $1 to make $3 (excellent)

## Trading Recommendations

### Using the Analysis for Trading

#### Step 1: Find Opportunities

**Use Top Opportunities Tab:**
- Pre-filtered for strong signals
- Highest strength shown first
- Look for:
  - STRONG BUY or STRONG SELL signals
  - Signal strength > 50%
  - Multiple supporting factors

#### Step 2: Review the Analysis

**Check these factors:**

1. **Signal Consensus:**
   - Are multiple indicators aligned?
   - Example: RSI oversold + MACD bullish + Supertrend up = Strong consensus

2. **Candlestick Pattern:**
   - Is there a pattern detected?
   - What's the pattern strength? (Prefer 7+ /10)
   - Does pattern align with signal?

3. **Sentiment:**
   - Is sentiment supporting the signal?
   - Positive sentiment + BUY signal = Good
   - Negative sentiment + BUY signal = Be cautious

4. **Trading Setup:**
   - Is there a LONG or SHORT recommendation?
   - What's the confidence level? (HIGH preferred)
   - Is the risk/reward ratio good? (Prefer ≥ 1:2)

#### Step 3: Plan Your Trade

**If Trading Setup Shows:**

```
LONG Setup
Entry: $45,000
Stop Loss: $43,200 (4% risk)
Take Profit: $49,400 (9.78% profit)
Risk/Reward: 1:2.44
```

**Your Trading Plan:**
1. **Entry:** Place buy order at $45,000
2. **Stop Loss:** Place stop loss at $43,200
3. **Take Profit:** Place take profit at $49,400
4. **Position Size:** Calculate based on risk tolerance

**Position Sizing Example:**

If you have $10,000 account and want to risk 1%:
```
Account: $10,000
Risk per trade: 1% = $100
Entry: $45,000
Stop Loss: $43,200
Risk per coin: $45,000 - $43,200 = $1,800

Position size: $100 ÷ $1,800 = 0.0556 BTC

Total position value: 0.0556 × $45,000 = $2,500
```

#### Step 4: Execute and Monitor

**Execution:**
1. Enter position at recommended entry
2. Set stop loss immediately
3. Set take profit order
4. Monitor position

**Monitoring:**
1. Check if price respects support/resistance
2. Watch for new candlestick patterns
3. Re-analyze if conditions change
4. Trail stop loss as profit grows (optional)

### Trading Rules

#### Golden Rules

1. **Never trade without a stop loss**
   - Always use the recommended stop loss
   - Never remove stop loss hoping for reversal

2. **Respect your risk management**
   - Never risk more than 1-2% per trade
   - Use proper position sizing

3. **Don't chase trades**
   - Wait for proper entry point
   - Don't FOMO into trades

4. **Follow your plan**
   - Stick to entry, stop loss, take profit
   - Don't change plans mid-trade

5. **Use multiple confirmations**
   - Don't trade on signal alone
   - Look for pattern + signal + sentiment alignment

#### When to Trade

**High Confidence Trades:**
✅ STRONG BUY/SELL signal
✅ Strength > 50%
✅ Candlestick pattern detected (strength 7+)
✅ Multiple indicator consensus
✅ Sentiment aligned
✅ HIGH confidence trading setup
✅ Risk/Reward ≥ 1:2

**Medium Confidence Trades:**

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: How often should I run the analysis?**
A: Run analysis at the start of each trading session. For day trading, run every 2-4 hours. For swing trading, once daily is sufficient.

**Q: Can I use this for day trading?**
A: Yes, but the 4-hour candlestick patterns are better suited for swing trading (holding 1-7 days). For day trading, combine with shorter timeframe analysis.

**Q: Is the sentiment analysis real-time?**
A: Currently uses mock data. For real-time sentiment, you can integrate Twitter, Reddit, and Discord APIs (see SOCIAL_SENTIMENT_SETUP.md).

**Q: How accurate are the signals?**
A: No technical analysis is 100% accurate. Signals show probability, not certainty. Always use proper risk management. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

**Q: Can I customize the indicators?**
A: Yes, you can edit `technical_indicators.py` to adjust indicator parameters or add new indicators.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why does analysis take 30-60 seconds?**
A: The app fetches data for 13 markets, calculates 42+ indicators per market, analyzes patterns, and generates recommendations. This comprehensive analysis takes time.

**Q: Can I analyze more markets?**
A: Yes, edit `data_fetcher.py` and add symbols to `CRYPTO_PAIRS` or `FOREX_PAIRS` lists.

**Q: What data source does it use?**
A: Yahoo Finance API for all market data. Free, no API key required.

**Q: Can I run this on a schedule?**
A: Yes, you can set up a cron job (Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to run `run_analysis.py` at specific times.

**Q: Does it support stocks?**
A: Currently crypto and forex only. You can modify `data_fetcher.py` to add stock symbols.

### Trading Questions

**Q: Should I always follow the signals?**
A: No. Signals are recommendations based on technical analysis. Always do your own research and consider:
- Market conditions
- News events
- Your risk tolerance
- Your trading strategy

**Q: What if signal says BUY but pattern says SELL?**
A: This indicates conflicting signals. It's generally better to wait for clearer confirmation. Look for:
- Which has higher strength?
- What do most indicators say?
- What's the sentiment?

**Q: Can I adjust the stop loss?**
A: You can, but it's not recommended to widen stops (increase risk). You can trail stops up (reduce risk) as price moves in your favor.

**Q: What's a good risk/reward ratio?**
A: Minimum 1:2 (risk $1 to make $2). Professional traders often target 1:3 or higher. The app dynamically calculates based on market conditions.

**Q: How do I know when to exit?**
A: Three main exits:
1. **Stop Loss Hit** - Exit immediately, accept loss
2. **Take Profit Hit** - Exit immediately, take profit
3. **Signal Changes** - If strong BUY becomes SELL, consider exiting

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Analysis shows "No markets to display"?**
A: This usually means:
- No markets met the strength threshold
- Network issues fetching data
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page

**Q: Server won't start?**
A:
```bash
# Check if port 3000 is in use
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Kill the process
taskkill /PID <pid> /F

# Restart
python app.py
```

**Q: Getting import errors?**
A:
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Q: Page loads but no data shows?**
A:
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify Flask server is running
- Check if port 3000 is accessible
- Try different browser
